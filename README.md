```

## Your Task

Create a folder with your name under `src/main/java/students/` and build out the following class structure inside it:

**`Person`** — base class
- Fields: `id`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`
- Method: `getSummary()`

**`Student`** extends `Person`
- Additional fields: `gradeLevel`, `gpa`
- Methods: `getSummary()`, `isOnHonorRoll()`

**`Instructor`** extends `Person`
- Additional fields: `department`
- Methods: `getSummary()`, `createAnnouncement(String message)`

In your `Main` class, create a mix of `Student` and `Instructor` objects, store them in a single list, and print each one's summary.

## Requirements

- All fields must be private
- All classes require a constructor
- `Person` must be abstract
